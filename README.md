# BATTLESHIPS PROJECT

Used Flask as the main backend framework for the game. Used socketio and implemented a SQL database to keep data. This game features a full login and signup system and allows for
connection over local area network. I coded the front end in HTML, CSS and JS. JS also handled a few parts of the backend. This is the classic game of battleships that involve
two players taking turns shooting ships. On top of that, the game includes a chat feature, a score count and more.
